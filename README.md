# Sample Hardhat Project

This is the same contract for Patrick Collins' 32-hour course lesson 7, updated for
Ether 6.x. See [FundMe.test.js Updates needed for Ethers 6.x](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-fund-me-fcc/issues/177) for some of the updates. 

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn test
yarn test:staging
```
